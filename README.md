# Inclusion

Technically the site is opened when the **Digital Identifier Inclusion** report is published, but the committe approved draft can be view at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaY6yNopxCFC_3sBgeddnmM1psVkLmnS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109794657323597753486&rtpof=true&sd=true

Suggestions should be posted here - questions can by asked directly on the google doc itself.
