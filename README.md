# Inclusion

This repository is where feedback for any inclusion issues with the **Digital Identifier Inclusion** and related reports are to be collected and addressed.

Technically, the site is opened when the **Digital Identifier Inclusion** report is published, but the committee approved draft can be viewed at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaY6yNopxCFC_3sBgeddnmM1psVkLmnS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109794657323597753486&rtpof=true&sd=true

Suggestions should be posted as Issues here - questions can by asked directly on the Google doc itself.

“Digital public infrastructure is key everywhere, but especially in developing countries. We look forward to driving multi-stakeholder collaboration around the development and deployment of globally interoperable wallets that help close the gap between the digital ‘haves’ and ‘have nots'.” – Doreen Bogdan-Martin, ITU Secretary-General.
